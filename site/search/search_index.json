It also has predictive typing, built-in AI, and completely integrates with github.</p> <p>Once you download and open a new window, this is what you will see.</p> <p></p> <p>The left sidebar is called the primary one. You can switch between seeing your current folder, debugging, and extensions. The center of the screen is where the file you're editting will be. To see the right sidebar, go to View -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Secondary Side Bar. When you use R or Python, this will show every thing you have named in your code. The bottom of the screen is the terminal. This is where you interact with the actual computer. It will show you the output, or the error message of anything you run. Writing in the terminal is harder, and you can't change anything once it's run. When you need to interact directly with your computer - e.g. to download something or manipulate an actual file structure, you'll need to use the terminal. Today you will have to use the terminal a bit, because you'll be downloading everything.</p>"},{"location":"#github","title":"Github","text":"<p>You can think of GitHub as Pinterest, but for code.
