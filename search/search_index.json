This website is going to be for notes and guides, and I'm going to put the code files for you to download on Github (This assignment will explain exactly how to do it and Github will be really helpful for you I promise).</p> <p>Your first assignment is a lab going over the general set-up and what everything means.</p>"},{"location":"#where-will-i-code","title":"Where will I code?","text":""},{"location":"#vs-code","title":"VS Code","text":"<p>Click to download VS Code</p> <p>Visual Studio Code is a code editor (like google docs for code). It also has predictive typing, built-in AI, and completely integrates with github.</p> <p>Once you download and open a new window, this is what you will see.</p> <p></p> <p>The left sidebar is called the primary one. You can switch between seeing your current folder, debugging, and extensions. The center of the screen is where the file you're editting will be. To see the right sidebar, go to View -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Secondary Side Bar. When you use R or Python, this will show every thing you have named in your code. The bottom of the screen is the terminal. This is where you interact with the actual computer. It will show you the output, or the error message of anything you run. Writing in the terminal is harder, and you can't change anything once it's run. When you need to interact directly with your computer - e.g. to download something or manipulate an actual file structure, you'll need to use the terminal. Today you will have to use the terminal a bit, because you'll be downloading everything.</p>"},{"location":"#github","title":"Github","text":"<p>You can think of GitHub as Pinterest, but for code.

Keep the first terminal open, and don't click the X. In this terminal, you should be inside the pookie-code folder. If you're not, close this terminal too and repeat step 2 without the mkdir step.</li> <li>With the lab open on the center of your screen, click it, then press CTRL + ENTER on your keyboard to run the lab. This will open the lab as a tab in your browser.</li> <li>For today, play around with the input options. See how the graph changes based on the settings you choose.</li> <li>Once you've done that, take a look at the code for the app. The UI section creates the visible parts of the app, and the server creates the actual functions of the app. The server uses some if statements and a for loop. Compare the file to the app output, and find these parts of the code. How do they work? What values does the app accept? In your notes, write down five different input combinations, along with a description of the graph they create.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"}]}
